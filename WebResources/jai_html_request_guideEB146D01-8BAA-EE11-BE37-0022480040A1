    <h1>Request Guide</h1>

    <p>This guide will explain how to generate a new request:</p>

    <h2>Prompt</h2><br>

    First, you'll need to choose a pre-defined prompt to use in the Prompt field. These prompts have been engineered to perform a specific task, such as generating an ERD for a business use case, or generating documentation for a Power Automate flow.<br>

    You'll also need to set the temperature, you should choose a temperature that's between 0 (being deterministic) and 1 (being random). The higher the temperature, the more creative the output will be. Be aware that high temperatures can cause hallucinations.<br>

    <h2>Request Details</h2><br>

    Next, you'll need to provide some details about your request. This will help the AI to generate a more accurate response. Enter this in the "Request Text" field.<br>

    <h2>Send Request</h2><br>

    Finally, click "Submit Request" to send your request to the AI. The AI will then generate a response, which will be displayed in the "Response Text" field. Note responses can take a moment to complete.<br>
